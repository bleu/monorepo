# Gyro ECLP API

This API was made to do off-chain calculations that are not implemented on Balancer SOR (and not on our math package as well) for the ECLP Gyro Pool. We choose to create an API because the math was developed in this repo in python, so with this we can copy the code without have to translate it to another language.

## Requirements for running:
- have poetry installed
- run `poetry install`
